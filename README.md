#### Introduction
**MechaHaze** is an advanced audio processing system designed to handle sophisticated audio analysis and real-time interaction. This project integrates cutting-edge technologies in both frontend and backend development to provide a comprehensive tool for audio processing, visualization, and control.

The primary aim of MechaHaze is to serve professionals and enthusiasts in the audio industry, offering a versatile platform for audio analysis, editing, and live performance setups. Its modular design allows for scalability and adaptability, catering to a wide range of audio processing needs.

#### Features

**Audio Processing Capabilities**:
MechaHaze excels in advanced audio processing functionalities, including:
- Audio recording and listening.
- Audio fingerprinting for recognition and categorization.
- Sophisticated waveform analysis for detailed audio data interpretation.

**Frontend and Backend Integration**:
- The frontend is built using Fable for a seamless F# to JavaScript compilation, featuring modern React patterns for a dynamic user interface.
- State management is efficiently handled using Recoil, enabling responsive and interactive UI components.

**Real-Time Data Handling and Control**:
- Incorporates Open Sound Control (OSC) for swift responsiveness in real-time audio processing environments.
- Utilizes RabbitMQ for robust and scalable inter-process communication, facilitating a distributed system architecture.


#### Installation

**Prerequisites**:
- .NET 5 SDK: MechaHaze is built with .NET 5, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
- Node.js and npm/yarn: Required for managing frontend dependencies and scripts.
- Fable Compiler: For compiling F# source code to JavaScript for the frontend.
- RabbitMQ: Used for inter-process communication within the application.
